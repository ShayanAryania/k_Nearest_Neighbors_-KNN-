What is the KNN algorithm?

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. It is one of the popular and simplest classification and regression classifiers used in machine learning today.
While the KNN algorithm can be used for either regression or classification problems, it is typically used as a classification algorithm, working off the assumption that similar points can be found near one another.
